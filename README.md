# Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction
## Project Overview
### This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on a comprehensive dataset. Leveraging a range of data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and advanced classification algorithms, this solution aims to provide an accurate predictive tool that can potentially aid in early screening and intervention.

<em>Key Objectives:</em>

* Data Understanding & Preprocessing: Thoroughly examine the dataset, handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and transform categorical features into a suitable format for machine learning.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data distributions and relationships to gain insights into the factors influencing ASD.

* Model Development: Implement and evaluate various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, to identify the most effective predictive model.

* Performance Evaluation: Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using appropriate metrics and techniques like cross-validation and confusion matrices.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information from an Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) 10-item screening tool, along with demographic and medical history details.

### Features:

* `ID:` Unique patient identifier.

* `A1_Score to A10_Score:` Scores from the AQ-10 screening tool (binary: 0 or 1).

* `age:` Age of the patient in years.

* `gender:` Gender of the patient (f or m).

* `ethnicity:` Patient's ethnicity.

* `jaundice:` Indicates if the patient had jaundice at birth (yes or no).

* `austim:` Indicates if an immediate family member has been diagnosed with autism (yes or no).

* `contry_of_res:` Country of residence.

* `used_app_before:` Whether the patient underwent a screening test before (yes or no).

* `result:` Raw score from the AQ1-10 screening test.

* `age_desc:` Age group description (e.g., "18 and more").

* `relation:` Relationship of the person who completed the test (e.g., "Self", "Parent").

* `Class/ASD:` Target variable, classified as 0 (No ASD) or 1 (Yes ASD).

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
The initial data inspection revealed several aspects requiring preprocessing to ensure data quality and model readiness:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection:

The dataset was loaded using pandas.

df.head() and df.info() were used to get a quick overview of the data structure, column types, and non-null counts.

### Data Type Conversion:

* The age column, initially of float64 type, was converted to int64 to represent age as whole numbers.

Handling Irrelevant Columns:

The ID column was dropped as it's a unique identifier and not relevant for prediction.

The age_desc column was also dropped as the age column provides more granular numerical information.

Addressing Inconsistent Country Names:

Inconsistencies in the contry_of_res column (e.g., 'Viet nam' vs. 'Vietnam', 'AmericanSamoa' vs. 'United States', 'Hong Kong' vs. 'China') were standardized using a mapping dictionary and the .replace() method.

Target Class Distribution Analysis:

An analysis of the Class/ASD target variable (df['Class/ASD'].value_counts()) revealed a significant class imbalance:

Class 0 (No ASD): 639 instances

Class 1 (Yes ASD): 161 instances

This imbalance will be addressed later using techniques like SMOTE to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate analysis was performed on numerical columns to understand their distributions.

Age Distribution:

A histogram with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) was plotted for the age column.

The mean age was found to be approximately 27.96 years, and the median age was 24.0 years. The presence of a tail to the right indicates a right-skewed distribution, with a higher concentration of younger individuals and fewer older individuals in the dataset.

## Visualizations:

Result Score Distribution:

A histogram with KDE was plotted for the result column (AQ1-10 screening test score).

The mean result score was approximately 8.54, and the median was 9.61. This distribution also appears to be somewhat skewed, providing insights into the typical range of scores.

## Visualizations:

(Further EDA on categorical features and bivariate analysis would typically follow, but this summary focuses on the provided notebook content.)

Model Development and Evaluation
(The provided notebook snippet ends after EDA. To make this a "world-class" showcase, I will describe typical next steps and potential outcomes based on the imports and the problem statement. You would replace this with your actual model development and results.)

Feature Engineering & Encoding
Categorical Encoding: Categorical features (gender, ethnicity, jaundice, austim, contry_of_res, used_app_before, relation) would be converted into numerical representations using techniques like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding, as indicated by the LabelEncoder import.

Addressing Missing Values: Any remaining missing values (e.g., '?' in ethnicity and relation) would be handled through imputation or removal, depending on their prevalence and impact.

Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
Given the significant class imbalance in the Class/ASD target variable (639 non-ASD vs. 161 ASD), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) would be applied to the training data. This technique generates synthetic samples for the minority class, helping to balance the dataset and prevent the model from disproportionately favoring the majority class.

Model Training and Selection
Data Splitting: The dataset would be split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate the model's generalization performance.

Algorithms Explored:

Decision Tree Classifier: A foundational model for classification.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

XGBoost Classifier: A highly efficient and powerful gradient boosting framework known for its performance in various machine learning tasks.

Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV would be employed to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters for each model, maximizing their predictive power.

Cross-Validation: cross_val_score would be used to perform k-fold cross-validation, providing a more robust estimate of model performance and reducing the impact of data variability.

Model Evaluation
The performance of the trained models would be rigorously evaluated using standard classification metrics:

Accuracy Score: The proportion of correctly classified instances.

Confusion Matrix: A table that summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class, offering a detailed view of the model's performance, especially crucial in imbalanced datasets.

(Example output from a typical model evaluation, based on the snippet's accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report imports, and a common outcome for such datasets):

Accuracy Score:
 0.81875
Confusion Matrix:
 [[109  15]
 [ 14  22]]
Classification Report:
               precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.89      0.88      0.88       124
           1       0.59      0.61      0.60        36

    accuracy                           0.82       160
   macro avg       0.74      0.74      0.74       160
weighted avg       0.82      0.82      0.82       160

Interpretation of Results:

An overall accuracy of approximately 82% indicates a good general performance.

The confusion matrix shows the model correctly identified 109 non-ASD cases and 22 ASD cases. It misclassified 15 non-ASD as ASD (false positives) and 14 ASD as non-ASD (false negatives).

The classification report highlights the challenge with the minority class (ASD, class 1). While precision for class 0 is high (0.89), precision for class 1 is lower (0.59), meaning that when the model predicts ASD, it's correct about 59% of the time. Recall for class 1 is 0.61, indicating it captures 61% of actual ASD cases. The F1-score (0.60) is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

These results suggest that while the model performs well overall, further efforts could be made to improve its ability to correctly identify positive ASD cases, possibly through more advanced sampling techniques, feature engineering, or exploring different model architectures.

Model Persistence
The best-performing model would be saved using pickle for future deployment and inference, allowing it to be easily loaded and used without retraining.
